## Introduction
This **Discord bot** tries to replicate all of Sydney's features & personality *and a few extras*, like
- Suggested responses
- Web searching
- Image viewing
- Image generation
- ... and its full personality ðŸ˜Š

## Requirements
### *OpenAI*
To set up this bot yourself, you will need an [**OpenAI API key**](https://platform.openai.com/account/api-keys), with free credit or a connected credit card.
*Keep in mind that the GPT-3 queries have not been optimized for token usage yet, so it might get a bit expensive over time.*

### *Replicate*
To generate & view images, the bot uses various models from **[Replicate](https://replicate.com)**. Head over to [**here**](https://replicate.com/account) to view your API key, once you have created an account & connected a credit card.

## Create a Discord bot
You will need to create a Discord bot application [*here*](https://discord.com/developers/applications). The bot does not require any special intents.
Then, save the token and application ID for the next step.

## Configuration
Firstly, copy the configuration example in `src/config.example.json` to `src/config.json`, and follow all the steps inside the file.
You will have to fill out all required fields, or else the bot may not work as expected or at all.

## Building
**Firstly**, run `npm install` to obtain all the packages & depencies.
Then, run `npm run build` to build the bot.

Once built, you will be able to start the bot using `npm run start`.
